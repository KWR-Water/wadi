The following abbreviations are used throughtout the code for variable names:

* c\_ as a prefix for column
* m\_ as a prefix for map 
* rv for return value (or rv\_ when used as a prefix)


The InfoTable is a nested dictionary. The level-0 keys are indicated
by key_0 and their values are dict_1, whose keys are key_1.

TODO:

* strip_parenthesis not used in Mapper
* Implement use of T/F column for values below detection limit
