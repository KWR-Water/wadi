Example 2: import wide data
========================================================================================================

Inspection of the spreadsheet file 'testfile1_io.xlsx' shows that
its contents are a real mess. For example, some concentration data
are spread over two columns. Also the rows with column headers are 
not nicely aligned, there are empty rows and columns and there are
trailing rows with data that should be skipped. This example demonstrates
how WADI uses the keyword arguments of the :code:`read_excel` function to
import separate blocks of data (called 'panes') into a DataFrame.

Step 1: Initialize the WADI Importer class
==========================================

Nothing special needs to be done in this step, except to indicated that the
spreadsheet data are in 'wide' format.

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:
    :okwarning:

    import wadi as wd

    wi = wd.Importer(format='wide',
                    )

Step 2: Read the data
==========================================

In this step, three 'panes' are defined. Each takes a number of keyword
arguments. Basically all keyword arguments of a Pandas reader function, 
in this case :code:`read_excel`, are allowed. In this case, they are
:code:`skiprows`, :code:`usecols` and :code:`na_values`. The latter is 
used to filter out cell that have '999' as values. Note that the keyword
argument :code:`skiprows` accepts a list of (zero-based) row numbers to be
skipped, and for each pane this list is stored in :code:`rows2skip` before 
it is passed as an argument value for :code:`skiprows`. The row numbers,
unfortunately, must be counted manuall in the spreadsheet file. Not also 
how :code:`usecols` is used to grab only the relevant columns from the file.
By using Pandas' exhauastive functionality for reading spreadsheet and comma 
separated values (csv) files, WADI can handle almost any file, even if it's 
contents are a mess.

There are also a few keyword arguments that are specific to the 
:code:`read_data` function. These are :code:`datatype`, which tells WADI the
kind of data that is being read. Valid values are 'sampleinfo', for sample 
data that are not going to be processed (for example, unit conversion) in 
any way, and 'feature', for data that are going to be mapped and/or harmonized.

The keyword argument :code:`unit_row` tells :code:`read_data` on which row
in the spreadsheet it has to look for the (chemical concentration) units.
As with :code:`skiprows`, the number has to be looked up by the user by 
inspecting the contents of the spreadsheet file.

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:
    :okwarning:

    rows2skip = list(range(9)) + [22, 23] + list(range(25, 35))
    df0_kwargs = {'skiprows': rows2skip, 'usecols': "C:E", 'datatype': 'sampleinfo'}

    rows2skip = list(range(3)) + list(range(4, 10)) + [22, 23]
    df1_kwargs = {'skiprows': rows2skip, 'usecols': "F:AF", 'units_row': 4, 'datatype': 'feature', 'na_values': [999]}

    rows2skip = list(range(8)) + [9, 22, 23]
    df2_kwargs = {'skiprows': rows2skip, 'usecols': "AG", 'datatype': 'sampleinfo'}

    wi.read_data(file_path='example_2.xlsx',
                panes=[df0_kwargs, df1_kwargs, df2_kwargs])

Once the data have been read, the contents of the DataFrame that was imported
can be inspected. Note how Pandas has automatically numbered the second column
of duplicate columns by appending '.1'.

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:
    :okwarning:

    wi.df.head()

Step 3: Map the data and units
==========================================

The data are mapped using a dictionary that matches the original column names
to the desired column names. In the code below, this dictionary is created
manually and is stored as :code:`feature_dict`. Note how a mistake has 
creeped in the spelling of 'Nitrate' in the spreadsheet: by accident the 
Dutch word was typed in the first column. It will turn out later 
that this mistake does not cause any problems, because
the 'fuzzy' search algorithm is used. This alogrithm finds a match if two
terms are sufficiently close based on score between 0 and 100 percent. The 
other match method used here is 'exact', which requires the search terms 
to be equal. The :code:`feature_dict` is assigned to the :code:`m_dict` 
keyword argument of the :code:`map_data` function. The match methods are
grouped in a list that is assigned to the :code:`match_method` keyword 
argument.

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:
    :okwarning:

    feature_dict = wd.MapperDict({'Phosphate': 'PO4', 
                                  'Nitrate': 'NO3', 
                                  'Nitrite': 'NO2',
                                  'Ammonium': 'NH4',
                                  'Silica': 'SiO2',
                                  'Sulphate': 'SO4', 
                                  'Sodium': 'Na',
                                  'Calcium': 'Ca',
                                  'Arsenic': 'As',
                                 })

    wi.map_data(m_dict=feature_dict,
                match_method=['exact', 'fuzzy'],
               )

Units are mapped with the :code:`map_units` function. In this case the 
preferred match method is 'regex', which uses a special WADI search 
method that tries to decipher the format of the units string. For example,
it can tell the difference between 'mg N/l', 'mg N/l NO3' or 'mg/l NO3', and 
knows what molecular weight to use when mass units are to be converted to 
molar units. In this case there are also a few symbols that need to be replaced
for the unit mapping to be successful. These are passed as a dictionary with
the keyword arguments :code:`replace_strings`.

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:
    :okwarning:

    wi.map_units(match_method=['regex'],
                 replace_strings={'Î¼': 'u', '-': ' ', '%': 'percent'},
                )

The code above did not generate any output but the result of the mapping
is summarized in the file 'name_mapping_summary.xlsx'.

Step 4: Harmonize the data
==========================================

The :code:`harmonize` function is used below to combine duplicate columns.
The columns to be combined must be grouped in a list of at least 2 column
names. The data in the first column in the list will be overwritten with data
from the next column where the values in the first column are NaN (not 
a number). More than two columns are allowed as well, WADI will simply
try to fill up as many NaN values as possible. Note that eight column pairs
are selected for combining and that these are grouped in a list. This means
that the value passed for :code:`merge_columns` must always be a nested list,
even if only one set of column names is passed.

The :code:`harmonize` functiona also has a keyword argument 
:code:`drop_columns`, which takes a list of column names that will be deleted.

The :code:`target_units` keyword argument specifies what (concentration) units
will be used for the feature data, in this case the values will be converted
to 'mmol/l'. This value can be overridden for individual columns with the
:code:`override_units` keyword argument. In this case, arsenic will be 
converted to umol/l.

Note that behind the scenes, WADI relies on the 'pint' library to convert the
units. Any problems that it encountered will be recorded in the log file 
(testfile1_io.log in this example). It is strongly recommended that the user
ALWAYS checks the log file to verify that no unexpected behavior occurred.

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:
    :okwarning:

    df = wi.harmonize(merge_columns=[['Phosphate', 'Phosphate.1'], 
                                     ['Nitraat', 'Nitrate'],
                                     ['Nitrite', 'Nitrite.1'],
                                     ['Ammonium', 'Ammonium.1'],
                                     ['Silica', 'Silica.1'],
                                     ['Sulphate', 'Sulphate.1'],
                                     ['Calcium', 'Calcium.1'],
                                     ['Arsenic', 'Arsenic.1'],
                                    ], 
                     drop_columns=['Unnamed: 18'],
                     target_units = 'mmol/l',
                     override_units = {'Arsenic': 'umol/l'},
                     )

    df.head()

Displaying the DataFrame does not show the values for arsenic. To verify
that the values were converted correctly the column name can be specified

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:
    :okwarning:

    df['As'].head()

Finally, the resulting DataFrame can be saved to an Excel file using the
:code:`to_excel` function.

.. ipython:: python
    :okexcept:
    :okwarning:

    df.to_excel('example_2_wadied.xlsx')
